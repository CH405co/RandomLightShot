# RandomLightShot
This is a simple Python program for people who are too lazy to type in new URLs. Loads of fun, hours of entertainment!

USEAGE:
1. Ensure that you have Python3 installed on your computer, run the main file like any other PY file.
2. Enter the amount of time "X" (in seconds) that you want between each new link.
3. A new tab will pop up with a link to a random screenshot every X seconds. Don't forget to close old tabs!
4. To stop the code, go to the terminal where the file is running and press CTRL-C, or just close the window.

If it doesn't work on Windows, open the command prompt and type
pip3 install random
pip3 install string
pip3 install time
pip3 install webbrowser

(If "pip3" isn't found, just use "pip")

If it doesn't work on Linux, open a terminal and type
sudo pip3 install random
sudo pip3 install string
sudo pip3 install time
sudo pip3 install webbrowser

I hope this works well, and I'll release more updates and features as I can come up with them!
